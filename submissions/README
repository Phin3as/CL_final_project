To execute import script.py


Then load data using :

train_X,train_Y,test_X = load_data()

note that this will require data to be present in the data directory.

Then call the appropriate driver function. For our final submissions call :

predicted_labels = svm_driver_sklearn(train_X,train_Y,test_X)


Other models are present in the models.py file.
